# steam-deck-calculator

Site to estimate order availability for the steam deck.

Runs on Apache and Nginx, just download the code.

It is designed to be extensible and if you are a developer, easy to add your own calculator to (submit PRs).

It is using pure JS, CSS, and HTML for simplicity. Typing would be nice, but not everyone has a typescript environment.
